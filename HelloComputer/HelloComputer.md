# Hello, Computer!

> Computers run the world, that's obvious! *What is it that computers do?* Now, that's less obvious. There are several, equally good, answers to that question. One may give an 'engineering' answer by talking about microchips or motherboards. One may also give a theoretical answer by talking of automata or Turing Machines. Alternatively, one may give a philosophical and slightly more abstract answer. In other words, instead of diving into the physical and theoretical implementations of a computer, one could try and explore what computers *conceptually* do.

#### Outline

Section 1. Inspired from the Analytic Philosophy of Language, I outline my method behind answering the question "what is is that computers *conceptually* do?".

Section 2. I outline my answer (dubbed "The Linguistic Answer") to what computers conceptually do. Fundamentally, my Linguistic Answer characterizes computation as **symbolic manipulation**.

Section 3. I take a slight detour in outlining the relationship between my Linguistic Answer and two paradigms of programming- the imperative paradigm (think JS or Python) and the declarative/functional paradigm (think Haskell or Agda).

Section 4. I briefly look at the philosophical implications of my Linguistic Answer.

### 1. An Issue Of Method

I'll take an Analytic route in trying to get to the bottom of what a computation is. This means that I begin by analyzing the meaning of the word "computation". Finding the meaning of a word is notoriously tricky especially if you're operating in a vacuum. What I mean is that it is quite hard (some would argue impossible!) to find the meaning of a word if we are not given some context on how that word is used. In summary, we need some kind of reference point to anchor our analysis of a particular word. It is easier to do that with words that refer to concrete and non-abstract objects. For example, if you want to find the meaning of the word "tree", that's fine. You simply look for people speaking about trees which they can *physically* interact with. However`, our goal in this article is to find the meaning of the word "computation" which refers to a non-physical concept rather than a physical object (bear in mind that we're not asking what a computer is but rather what a computer *conceptually* does). So, to find that anchor on which we shall base our analysis of the meaning of "computation", I shall turn to our intuitions.
