# Hello, Computer!

Maybe, as a computer user (as most of us are today), you may have looked at your computer and asked yourself "what is it that this metal machine is really doing?". There are several, equally good, answers to that question. One could take the engineering route and talk about CPU's, cables and what not. One could also take a philosophical and more abstract route. So, instead of diving into the physical implementations of a computer, we could try and see what a computer is *conceptually* doing. Basically, we could come up with a conceptual answer to what a *computation* is. This is what this article intends on doing. In particular, I begin by talking about how I approach the . Afterwards, I look at two formal answers to what a computation is- the turing machine and the lambda calculus. In doing so, I adapt these formal approaches to my own approach. Lastly, I talk about the implications (and limitations of my approach).
