# Hello, Computer!

> Computers run the world, that's obvious! *What is it that computers do?* Now, that's less obvious. There are several, equally good, answers to that question. One may give an 'engineering' answer by talking about microchips or motherboards. One may also give a theoretical answer by talking of automata or Turing Machines. Alternatively, one may give a philosophical and slightly more abstract answer. In other words, instead of diving into the physical and theoretical implementations of a computer, one could try and explore what computers *conceptually* do.

#### Outline

Section 1. Inspired from the Analytic Philosophy of Language, I outline my method behind answering the question "what is is that computers *conceptually* do?".

Section 2. I outline my answer (dubbed "The Linguistic Answer") to what computers conceptually do. Fundamentally, my Linguistic Answer characterizes computation as **symbolic manipulation**.

Section 3. I take a slight detour in outlining the relationship between my Linguistic Answer and two paradigms of programming- the imperative paradigm (think JS or Python) and the declarative/functional paradigm (think Haskell or Agda).

Section 4. I briefly look at the philosophical implications of my Linguistic Answer.


### 1. An Issue Of Method

Very often, Analytic Philosophers of Language approach a question, such as our very own "what is it that computers conceptually do", by simplifying that question into a simpler, but more abstract, question. The reasoning behind this approach is that such simplification allows us to better pin down the real issue at stake. With this in mind, it seems quite intuitive that we may simplify our aforementioned question into "what is a computation?". With this simplified question in hand, we follow the footsteps of these Analytic Philosophers in saying that the answer to our simplified question is finding the meaning of the word "Computation".

Finding the meaning behind words is notoriously tricky especially if you're operating in a vacuum. What I mean is that it is hard (some would argue impossible) to find the meaning of a word if we are not given some context on how that word is used or what our general intuitions behind that word are. So, we would need some kind of anchor on which to base our our analysis of the meaning of the word "Computation". It would have been less hard to do find that anchor if the word "Computation" referred to a physical object. For example, if we wanted to analyse the meaning of the word "Arbre", we could simply observe how French speakers use the word "Arbre" as they are interacting with physical trees. Unfortunately for us, the word "Computation" does not intuitively seem to refer to an abstract and non-physical object (bear in mind that we're not trying to find what computers are, but rather, what is is that they *conceptually* do). So, given the non-physicality of Computation, we need to find the anchor on which we shall base our analysis of the meaning of the word "Computation".
