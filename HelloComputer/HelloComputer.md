# Hello, Computer!


Maybe, as a computer user (as most of us are today), you may have looked at your computer and asked yourself "what is it that this metal machine is really doing?". There are several, equally good, answers to that question. One could take the engineering route and talk about CPU's, cables and what not. One could also take a philosophical and more abstract route. So, instead of diving into the physical implementations of a computer, we could try and see what a computer is *conceptually* doing. Basically, we could come up with a conceptual answer to what a *computation* is. This is what this article intends on doing. In particular, I begin by talking about how I approach the . Afterwards, I look at two formal answers to what a computation is- the turing machine and the lambda calculus. In doing so, I adapt these formal approaches to my own approach. Lastly, I talk about the implications (and limitations of my approach).


### An Issue Of Method

I'll take an Analytic route in trying to get to the bottom of what a computation is. This means that I begin by analyzing the meaning of the word "computation". Finding the meaning of a word is notoriously tricky especially if you're operating in a vacuum. What I mean is that it is quite hard (some would argue impossible!) to find the meaning of a word if we are not given some context on how that word is used. In summary, we need some kind of reference point to anchor our analysis of a particular word. It is easier to do that with words that refer to concrete and non-abstract objects. For example, if you want to find the meaning of the word "tree", that's fine. You simply look for people speaking about trees which they can *physically* interact with. However`, our goal in this article is to find the meaning of the word "computation" which refers to a non-physical concept rather than a physical object (bear in mind that we're not asking what a computer is but rather what a computer *conceptually* does). So, to find that anchor on which we shall base our analysis of the meaning of "computation", I shall turn to our intuitions.
