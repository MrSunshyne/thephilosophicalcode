# Too Much To Handle

> Computers can do infinitely many things and yet, we could never count the things that they can't do. In this short article, we'll explore a neat theorem that proves cannot do.

### 1. Unsolvable Problems

There's a neat theorem that usually goes by the name of "the existence of unsolvable problems".
I like to think that problem solving lies at the heart of coding. We code to solve problems. Thing is problems comes in different shapes and sizes. Each problem is different. Each client is different. Each problem is different.

We see

Since each . We may conclude that

So, we can see a problem as box that takes an input and needs an output.


### 2. Philosophically Dodgy

  beyond *all* doubt. Once we have a mathematical proof, there is no way we can.


### 3. Possible Worlds


### 4.  Possibly Countable
