# Too Much To Handle

> Problem solving lies at the heart of Software Engineering. However, there's a fundamental limit to how many programs we can build compared to how many computational problems there can be. In this article, we'll informally prove that such a limit exists because there are infinitely way more problems than programs. Put it simply, we'll show that there exists unsolvable computational problems.

### 1. The Road Ahead.

'Why does your cat not love you?' - not a computational problem.

Our goal is simple. We need to prove that there are more computational problems than there are computer programs. Firstly, we'll . Lastly, we'll demonstrate how the size of the Set of Real Numbers is larger than the size of the Set of Natural Numbers. Ergo, there are more problems than programs.
### 1. Programs For Dummies.

Let's start with a simple program. To me, "Hello World" hits the sweet spot when it comes to simple programs.

```
  console.log("Hello World");
```

We start by giving each reserve keyword in a particular programming language a unique ID.

so, `const` can be `1`,

From here on, we can easily imagine how we can paraphrase any JavaScript program into a particular but unique number.

A few caveats before we continue.

1. It is entirely possible that two numbers refer to two programs that do the same thing. That's fine, the important thing here is that a number does not refer to more than one program.
2. Some numbers might refer to programs that crash, have syntax errors or are useless. That's also fine. The subtley here is that the number of possible computer programs isn't strictly equal to the size of the Natural numbers but is less or equal to that size.

### 2. Problems For Dummies.

So far, we have

### 3. The Struggle Is Real.

### 4. Some Infinities Are Bigger Than Other Infinities.

> Even if we had all the time, energy , we would never be able to solve all computational problems. If the . Here's the big takeaway. Imagine that you had a infinite number of and they could live eternally. You'll never be able to solve all the computational problems.

### PS

1. There's not much explicit. That's my fault, to . However, that does not mean that I can't leave you with some breadcrumbs to follow.
