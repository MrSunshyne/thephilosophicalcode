# Keep It Dry

> *Don't Repeat Yourself* (DRY for short) is a cherished principle guiding developers world-wide. In this article, we'll take a philosophical dive into what it implies and how it pushes Philosophy to its limits.

### 1. Don't Repeat Yourself

  Imagine that we have to write a block of code that tells us whether a number is even or odd. We may code the following in order to check the evenness of 14 and 15.

```
  # If you're not used to coding or Ruby, please find comments (like this one) before each line of code explaining what that line does.


  # our code checks whether the remainder of dividing 15 by 2 is 0
  if 15 % 2 == 0
    # our code prints "15 is even" if the remainder is 0
    puts '15 is even'
  else
    # our code prints "15 is odd" if the remainder isn't 0
    puts '15 is odd'
  end

  if 14 % 2 == 0
    puts '14 is even'
  else
    puts '14 is odd'
  end
```

  Eventually, our code prints `15 is odd` and `14 is even`. That's cool but notice how we're repeating ourselves. We wrote virtually the same code to check the evenness of 14 and 15. What if we had a thousand numbers instead of just the two? It would be a waste of time to write repeating code to check the evenness of a thousand numbers. Naturally, this is where the DRY principle kicks in. Irrespective of how many numbers we are given, we want to be able to check their evenness using only a few lines of non-repeating code. In doing so, our code becomes adaptable, scalable and repeatable! To do this, let's use functions. Basically, a function takes some input, does something with it and returns an output. So, let's code a function called `even()` that takes a number, checks for its evenness and outputs whether it is even or odd.

```
  # our function takes a number as input
  def even(number)
    # our function checks if the remainder of dividing our number by 2 is 0
    if number % 2 == 0
      "#{number} is even"
    else
      "#{number} is odd"
    end
  end
```

  We can now check whether 15 and 14 are even by calling `even()` with them- `puts even(14)` prints `14 is even` and `puts even(15)` prints `15 is odd`. In doing so, we don't write repeating if-statements anymore. We don't repeat ourselves!

### 2. Layers Of Abstractions

  In the wild word of code, there are obviously way more complex scenarios than checking for evenness. Irrespective of such complexity, the *raison d'Ãªtre* of the DRY principle stays the same- *We don't waste our time in writing repeating code because our code should be adaptable, scalable and re-usable.* We've seen that functions are a neat way to keep our code dry. In other words, functions *abstract away* from unnecessary and repeating details. On this note, I believe that it is interesting to notice how this abstraction behind programming functions is analogous to how nicknaming works in human languages.

  Let's pretend that we've encountered an odd-looking person at the market with a shabby cap. Let's call them "Toto". Notice how the nickname "Toto" abstracts away from *describing* that person. In particular, anytime we speak of them, we would rather use the word "Toto" rather than the long-winded description "that odd-looking person with a shabby cap at the market". Here, we see how the nickname "Toto" is analogous to the programming function `even()`. They are both ways of abstracting away from unnecessary and repeating details. They are both keeping it dry! `even()` is a non-repeating way to check for evenness, "Toto" is a non-repeating way of speaking of an odd-looking person. In a cheeky way, it seems that the DRY principle doesn't only guide developers but it also guides pretty much everyone engaged in language (whether spoken, written, signed or merely mental).

  So far, we've seen an interesting relationship between a coding principle and human languages. So, let's dive further into the matter. It seems that abstraction, whether in human languages or programming functions, rely heavily on information preservation. To clarify, let's go back to our `even()` function. Recall that `even()` is an abstraction of our if-statements checking whether the remainder of dividing an input by 2 is 0. So, we may say that `even()` preserves the information associated with these if-statements. In turn, these if-statements themselves are preserving information! For example, we used the modulo operator `%` in these if-statements. Interestingly, the modulo operator itself is an abstraction of a more complex code that computes the remainder of dividing a number by another. So, it is preserving the information associated with this more complex code. We do not have to stop here. Our code is in Ruby. A quick google would tell us that Ruby is implemented using C. So, Ruby itself is high-level abstraction of code written in the low-level language C. We can go further down this rabbit hole until we reach the infamous Machine code (or should we stop here?).

  All the way from Machine code, to C, to Ruby, to `even()`, information is preserved! Intuitively, this form of information preservation gives rise a layered structure- a sort of layered pyramid whereby each layer preserves the information associated with its bottom layer. So, each layer is an abstraction of its bottom layer. Surprisingly (or maybe not), this pyramidal structure creeps up with our nickname "Toto". To clarify, recall that the word "Toto" is an abstraction of the description "that odd-looking person with a shabby cap at the market". Intuitive, the word "Toto" preserves the information contained in that description. In turn, this description itself is composed of other words like "odd-looking" and others. A quick dictionary search would tell us that the word "odd-looking" it itself defined using other words. So, the word "odd-looking" is itself an abstraction. But wait, these very words that define "odd-looking" are themselves defined using other words and, hence, are abstractions! So, we start to see this amazingly complex layered pyramid of linguistic abstraction where each layer is made up of a group of words. Each layer abstract away from its bottom layer and preserves the information of that bottom layer.

  In sum, the `even()` function and the nickname "Toto" are both part of complex layered pyramids of abstractions. Among all this complexity, a very intuitive, but interesting, question pops up- "what lies at the bottom of these pyramids?". We said that each layer is preserving information of its bottom layer. However, we're nearing paradox-land if we say that the last layer of our pyramid is preserving information from its bottom layer. By definition, there is no bottom layer to the last layer...This may lead us to believe that the last layer contains information at its purest state. It contains information that cannot be further broken down- a sort of atomic information. Alternatively, there could be no such last layer. Our pyramids of abstractions may not have a bottom and it's just turtles all the way down! Absurd yes but logically possible.

### 3. Can The Last Layer Please Stand Up?

  I believe that there's a very attractive argument to believe that there is a bottom layer and that it's not just turtles stacked on top of each other. One good argument for believing that such a bottom exist comes from natural language itself. It says that we're humans with limited mental powers. It would seem nonsensical to believe that humans, with limited powers, could process . If we do it whenever we communicate, the sheer amount of complexity of the abstractions pyramids would have humans short-circuit. Since we don't see humans short-circuiting everywhere from using languages, it seems to believe that there is a bottom layer to our linguistic pyramids of abstractions.

  Think of a time when you heard or saw a kid uttering their first word. Isn't it amazing how such a young brain deals with such complexity? They'll then grow up. In a cheeky way (yet again), the DRY principle is guiding them.
### 4. Confused Talk, Confused Philosophy


### PS

  Here's two quick, but highly important, disclaimers before you leave.


  1. Human languages and abstraction are way more complex phenomena than how I've written about them in this article. I only simplified these phenomena in trying to get a point across. For example, I've made heavy use of the nickname "Toto" but this nicknaming example is not and should not be taken as a definitive picture of how nicknaming in human languages generally work. Instead, it is only a faint picture of my own philosophical thoughts and experiences with nicknaming in the English language. I believe that we should share these linguistic experiences but we *must not* believe that our own linguistic constraints, experiences and phenomena can be imposed on those who do not share our language. Instead, we *must* observe and interact with as many languages and people as possible with a human-focused, empathetic, open-minded and empirical approach. Philosophy and Humanity itself don't need apathetic and unfounded approaches anymore.


  2. We may further simplify our `even()` function as follows.
  ```
    def even(number)
      (number % 2).zero? ? "#{number} is even" : "#{number} is odd"
    end
  ```
  We could also check if the arguments are not numbers or `null`. To avoid all that hassle and to keep it dry, we can instead use Ruby's built-in `#even?` method (In Ruby, functions are called "methods" ðŸ˜‰).
