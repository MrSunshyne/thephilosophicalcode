# Problematic By Definition

> In theory, we . We'll take a dig at how we usually define computational problems. We'll explore

### 1. The Road Ahead

  We begin by establishing a philosophical framework on how we come up with formal definitions. We'll see this as a way of building bridges from reality to our formal universe. This will leave us with the problem that we may have left some things behind and we'll see how some cracks start to form in our framework. By employing a neat trick, we'll see how we may exploit the various uses of language to crystalize our worries. Once crystalized, we'll look at how we may philosophically assess what we're left with. Just bear in mind that we will be asking more questions that giving answers.

### 2. A Note On Humility

  Philosophers . However, we should not . When looking at a formal system, . The aim is not to discredit the system nor to discredit the years of research in the area. The aim, to me, is to further explore and maybe catch something that we've missed. It does not really matter if we do not find anything philosophically interesting. Philosophical progress is a slow process. So, as you read this article, bear in mind that we're not taking a dig at Theoretical Computer Science. We're simply exploring around for the sake of exploration.
